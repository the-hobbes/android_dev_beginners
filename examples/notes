linear vs relative layout

linear layout:
- good for aligning things into rows or columns
- can divide a space with layout weights
- orientation and layout weight

relative layouts:
- good for positioning elements relative to one another
- for example, to put b below a, or c in the lower left hand corner of the screen
- can also overlap views
- positioning views relative to sibling and parent (toLeft, alignParent, etc...)

Steps to drawing an app:
1) choose views
2) position views (linear or relative layout?)
3) style the views (color, font, etc...)
